// Practice Problem-2:

// Getting out of school in a hurry, but when crossing the road, the traffic signal is red. In this case, if you try to cross the road, it can be dangerous. If it is yellow then you should stop. And if the traffic signal is green then you should cross the road. So write a code. Where we have a variable called signal. Its value can be green, yellow or red. Different work will be done accordingly. So, write that code quickly.
